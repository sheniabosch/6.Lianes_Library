# 6.Lianes_Library
Case Study – Liane’s Library Management System (Completed)

Objective: Built a fully functional, user-friendly library management system for Liane, a passionate book collector, using Python, SQL, and Streamlit.
Project Goal: Created an intuitive desktop app that lets Liane track her personal book collection—add, search, update, and delete titles—backed by a local SQLite database, all without leaving her cozy reading nook.
Key Achievements:
Migrated workflows from Google Colab to a local development environment with VS Code and virtual environments.
Designed a normalized SQLite database with tables for books, authors, genres, and reading status.
Connected Python to SQL using sqlite3 and pandas for seamless CRUD operations.
Deployed a polished Streamlit web app with search filters, cover image uploads, and real-time updates.

Focus: End-to-end data application development—because every bookworm deserves a digital librarian.
Schema design, normalization, indexing, and query optimization

Moving from Colab to Local 
Set up local Python, venv, Jupyter, and Git

Connecting SQL and Python
Executed parameterized queries, avoided SQL injection

Streamlit
Built interactive UI with forms, dataframes, and file uploaders
